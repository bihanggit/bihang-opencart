# Installation

Copy the files from `upload` to your OpenCart installation directory.


# Configuration

1. Create an API key at [bihang.com](http://bihang.com) .
2. In the opencart administration under Extensions->Payments, click the "Install"
   link on the bihang row.
3. Also under Extensions->Payments, click the "Edit" link on the bihang row.
4. Set the API key to the key you created in step 1.  
5. Set the status to enabled (this activates the bihang payment extension and 
    enabled shoppers to select the bihang payment method).
6. Select a sort order.  The sort order determines the ordering of payment options
    presented to the shopper.
